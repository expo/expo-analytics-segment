# expo-analytics-segment

> Source code for the deprecated expo-analytics-segment package. This module is removed from Expo SDK in SDK 46. There will be no replacement that works with the classic build service (`expo build`) because [the classic build service has been superseded by **EAS Build**](https://blog.expo.dev/turtle-goes-out-to-sea-d334db2a6b60). With **EAS Build*** and [Development Builds](/development/introduction.md), you should use official [@segment/analytics-react-native](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native) instead.
